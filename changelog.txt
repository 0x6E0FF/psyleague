[current]
* cmd_play_game: script has a new json return format + allows for returning multiple games; old format is still allowed 
* .games file: format changed to json (allows for custom data)
* bot update: -n/--new_name renames bot (this is only partially supported as this doesn't change the bot executable file; warning: potentially very slow as this has to update whole .games file)
