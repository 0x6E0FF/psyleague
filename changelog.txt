[0.3.0]
* cmd_play_game: script has a new json return format + allows for returning multiple games; old format is still allowed 
* .games file: format changed to json (allows for custom data)
* run: --workers N overrides number of workers set in the config file
* bot show: -s/--resample N shows ranking using bootstrapped (resampling with replacement) with N games
* bot remove: removes bot with all games & recalculates whole ranking (might take a while to execute)
